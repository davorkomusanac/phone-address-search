# phone-address-search
Manage people's phone numbers and addresses

This is a project that was done through a MOOC course (Object-Oriented programming with Java, part II) by University of Helsinki. 
This specific project was the end project for week 9 ( https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-9/ ).

As it is a part of the course, it is validated through TMC which runs the tests online, so my project had to be modified in some parts to accommodate the tests so that I would get points for it.

This is how the project should work:

Create an application to manage people phone numbers and addresses.

Implement the following functionality:

1 adding a phone number to the relative person 

2 phone number search by person 

3 name search by phone number 

4 adding an address to the relative person

5 personal information search (search for a person's address and phone number)

6 removing a person's information

7 filtered search by keyword (retrieving a list which must be sorted by name in alphabetic order), the keyword can appear in the name or address
